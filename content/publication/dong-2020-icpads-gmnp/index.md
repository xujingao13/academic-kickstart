abstract: "Visual peer-to-peer navigation is a suitable solution for indoor navigation for it relieves the labor of site-survey and eliminates infrastructure dependence. However, a major drawback hampers its application, as the peer-to-peer mode suffers from a deficiency of paths in large indoor scenarios with multifarious places-of-interest. Nevertheless, we propose one with a profound crowdsourcing scheme that addresses the drawback by merging the paths of different leaders' into a global map. To realize the idea, we further deal with entailed challenges, namely the unidirectional disadvantage, the scale ambiguity, and large computational overhead. We design a navigation strategy to solve the unidirectional problem and turn to VIO to tackle scale ambiguity. We devise a mobile-edge architecture to enable real-time navigation (30fps, 100ms end-to-end delay) and lighten the burden of smartphones (35% battery life for 2h35min) while assuring the accuracy of localization and map construction. Through experimental validations, we show that P2P navigation, previously relying on the abundance of independent paths, can enjoy a sufficiency of navigation paths with a crowdsourced global map. The experiments demonstrate a navigation success rate of 100% and spatial offset of less than 3.2m, better than existing works."
